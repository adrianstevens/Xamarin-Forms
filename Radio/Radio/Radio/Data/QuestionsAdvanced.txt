A-1-1-1 (D) What is the meaning of the term "time constant" in an RL circuit?
A	The time required for the current in the circuit to build up to 36.8% of the maximum value

C	The time required for the voltage in the circuit to build up to 36.8% of the maximum value
D	The time required for the current in the circuit to build up to 63.2% of the maximum value
> Inductance is a property of circuits that oppose changes in current. The time constant is the time current WOULD need to reach final value IF the initial rate of change COULD be maintained. The time constant in seconds equals L in henrys divided by R in ohms:  the lower the resistance, the greater the rate of change resulting in greater opposition. The current after 1, 2 and 5 time constants is respectively 63%, 87% and 100% of the final value. With capacitors, the ratios are the same but they relate to voltage;  the time constant then becomes R times C.

A	a diagonal straight line
B	a horizontal straight line
C	an ellipse
D	a circle
> Two in-phase signals of the same frequency applied to the X and Y amplifiers will grow exactly at the same rate:  equal deflection on the X and Y create a trace at a 45 degree angle. Ponder these X and Y values: 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, etc. A precise 180 degree phase difference has a similar effect except the trace appears in the other two quadrants. Ponder these X and Y values: 1 and -1, 2 and -2, 3 and -3, etc. [other angles correspond to the sine function of the ratio of Y as the ellipse crosses the vertical centre axis to the maximum Y value.]
A-3-5-8 (D) A 100-kHz signal is applied to the horizontal channel of an oscilloscope. A signal of unknown frequency is applied to the vertical channel. The resultant wave form has 5 loops displayed vertically and 2 loops horizontally. The unknown frequency is:

> Using the horizontal and vertical inputs on an oscilloscope, it is possible to compare the frequency of two sine waves or the phase relationship of two signals of equal frequency. The resulting pattern is called a "Lissajous Figure". Apply a known signal to the horizontal input. The ratio of the number of loops on the horizontal edge to the number on the vertical edge equals the ratio of the vertical frequency Y divided by horizontal frequency X:  the number of cycles the Y frequency covers during one horizontal cycle. In this Radiople, the unknown frequency is two fifths the known frequency. [French mathematician Jules-Antoine Lissajous]
A-3-5-9 (A) An oscilloscope probe must be compensated:
A	every time the probe is used with a different oscilloscope
B	when measuring a sine wave
C	through the addition of a high-value series resistor
D	when measuring a signal whose frequency varies
> "Probe compensation is the process of adjusting the probe's RC network divider so that the probe maintains its attenuation ratio over the probe's rated bandwidth. Most scopes have a square wave reference signal available on the front panel to use for compensating the probe. You can attach the probe tip to the probe compensation terminal and connect the probe to an input of the scope. Viewing the square wave reference signal, make the proper adjustments on the probe using a small screw driver so that the square waves on the scope screen look square" (Jae-yong Chang, Agilent Technologies). Given that the input circuitry cannot be identical between instruments, adjustment must be made every time a high-impedance probe is used with a different scope.

D	The RF signals of a nearby receiving antenna
> The most accurate representation of a transmitted signal can be viewed at the RF output of a transmitter. The correct method supposes the use of a "sampler" in the transmission line. That way, proper impedance match is maintained, instruments are protected from large voltages and extraneous signals are minimized.
A-3-6-1 (B) A meter has a full-scale deflection of 40 microamperes and an internal resistance of 96 ohms. You want it to read 0 to 1 mA. The value of the shunt to be used is:
A	40 ohms
B	4 ohms
C	24 ohms
D	16 ohms
> Extending the range of an ammeter supposes placing a shunt resistor across the meter movement to divert part of the current:  the shunt resistor = internal resistance divided by the multiplication factor from which we will first have deducted a quantity of one. For Radiople, making a 40 microamperes movement, with a 96 ohms internal resistance, read 1000 microamperes at full scale is a factor of 25:  the shunt = 96 ohms divided by 24 (i.e., 25 minus 1) = 4 ohms. Method B:  you could have computed voltage across the meter as 40 times 96 = 3840 microvolts ; and then, computed the shunt resistor as 3840 microvolts divided by 960 microamperes = 4 ohms.
A-3-6-2 (C) A moving-coil milliammeter having a full-scale deflection of 1 mA and an internal resistance of 0.5 ohms is to be converted to a voltmeter of 20 volts full-scale deflection. It would be necessary to insert a:
A	shunt resistance of 19 999.5 ohms
B	shunt resistance of 19.5 ohms
C	series resistance of 19 999.5 ohms
D	series resistance of 1 999.5 ohms
> Turning an ammeter into a voltmeter supposes inserting a suitable resistor in series with the instrument. For a current of 1 milliampere to flow under 20 volts, Ohm's Law tells us that a total resistance of 20,000 ohms is required. Subtract the internal resistance from that number and the actual series resistance needed is 19 999.5 ohms.
A-3-6-3 (D) A voltmeter having a range of 150 volts and an internal resistance of 150,000 ohms is to be extended to read 750 volts. The required multiplier resistor would have a value of:
A	1 500 ohms
B	750,000 ohms
C	1 200,000 ohms
D	600,000 ohms
> Extending the range of a voltmeter supposes placing a suitable multiplier resistor in series with the instrument:  the multiplier resistance = total internal resistance times the multiplication factor from which we will first have deducted a quantity of one. For Radiople, to turn a 150 volts meter, with an internal resistance of 150,000 ohms, to read 750 volts full scale is an increase of 5 times:  the multiplier resistor = 150,000 times 4 (i.e., 5 minus 1) = 600,000 ohms. Method B:  current for full-scale reading = 150 volts divided by 150,000 ohms = 1 milliampere. The total resistance that would allow 1 milliampere under 750 volts = 750,000 ohms. Deduct the internal resistance from this value to determine the multiplier resistor.

> Ammeter sensitivity is the current needed for a full-scale deflection.
A-3-6-5 (A) Voltmeter sensitivity is usually expressed in ohms per volt. This means that a voltmeter with a sensitivity of 20 kilohms per volt would be a:
A	50 microampere meter
B	1 milliampere meter
C	50 milliampere meter
D	100 milliampere meter
> Voltmeter sensitivity in ohms per volt:  i.e., the full-scale reading times the sensitivity yields total instrument resistance. Given total resistance, sensitivity can be computed as resistance divided by full-scale voltage reading:  e.g., a total of 150,000 ohms for a voltmeter reading 150 volts is a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt. Given sensitivity, the current needed for full-scale voltmeter reading follows Ohm's Law:  e.g., a voltmeter with a sensitivity of 20,000 ohms per volt uses a 50 microampere movement ( I = 1 volt divided by 20,000 = 50 microamperes ).
A-3-6-6 (B) The sensitivity of a voltmeter, whose resistance is 150,000 ohms on the 150-volt range, is:
A	150 ohms per volt
B	1000 ohms per volt
C	100,000 ohms per volt
D	10,000 ohms per volt
> Voltmeter sensitivity in ohms per volt:  i.e., the full-scale reading times the sensitivity yields total instrument resistance. Given total resistance, sensitivity can be computed as resistance divided by full-scale voltage reading:  e.g., a total of 150,000 ohms for a voltmeter reading 150 volts is a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt. Given sensitivity, the current needed for full-scale voltmeter reading follows Ohm's Law:  e.g., a voltmeter with a sensitivity of 20,000 ohms per volt uses a 50 microampere movement ( I = 1 volt divided by 20,000 = 50 microamperes ).

A-4-1-1 (D) For the same transformer secondary voltage, which rectifier has the highest average output voltage?
A	Half-wave
B	Quarter-wave
C	Full-wave centre-tap
D	Bridge
> The half-wave configuration is not as efficient at rectification as the full-wave. The real choice lies between the two full-wave alternatives:  bridge or full-wave with centre-tap. The bridge configuration rectifies the full secondary winding voltage. In contrast, the two-diode with centre-tapped transformer secondary only rectifies half the secondary voltage on each half-cycle.
A-4-1-2 (A) In a half-wave power supply with a capacitor input filter and a load drawing little or no current, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) across the diode can reach _____ times the RMS voltage.
A	2.8
B	0.45
C	5.6
D	1.4
> During conduction, the capacitor charges up to the peak value of the waveform (1.4 times the RMS value). On the opposite half-cycle, and from the diode's standpoint, the transformer winding reaching opposite peak value (1.4 times the RMS value) adds to the capacitor charge for a total of 2.8 times the RMS value.
A-4-1-3 (B) In a full-wave centre-tap power supply, regardless of load conditions, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) will be _____ times the RMS voltage:
A	1.4
B	2.8
C	0.636
D	0.707
> With the RMS voltage defined in this Radiople as the voltage from one extremity of the secondary winding to the centre-tap, each diode is subjected to 2.8 times the RMS voltage, peak reverse voltage from half the transformer winding adds to the peak DC output as a reverse bias on the diode during non-conduction ( each diode serves as a half-wave rectifier ).
A-4-1-4 (A) A full-wave bridge rectifier circuit makes use of both halves of the AC cycle, but unlike the full-wave centre-tap rectifier circuit it does not require:
A	a centre-tapped secondary on the transformer
B	any output filtering
C	a centre-tapped primary on the transformer
D	diodes across each leg of the transformer
> A four-diode bridge rectifier makes use of the full secondary winding without the need for a centre-tap.
A-4-1-5 (A) For a given transformer the maximum output voltage available from a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit will be:
A	double that of the full-wave centre-tap rectifier
B	half that of the full-wave centre-tap rectifier
C	the same as the full-wave centre-tap rectifier
D	the same as the half-wave rectifier
> The discussion relates to rectification, thus DC voltage output is the criteria. Imagine a 12 volts AC secondary with a centre tap. A bridge rectifier across the full secondary will obviously provide twice the voltage of a full-wave centre-tap rectifier where each diode draws from half the secondary. The bridge rectifier will also output slightly more DC voltage after filtering than a half-wave rectifier across the same full secondary.

A-4-1-8 (A) Full-wave voltage doublers:
A	use both halves of an AC wave
B	create four times the output voltage of half-wave doublers
C	use less power than half-wave doublers
D	are used only in high-frequency power supplies
> A voltage doubler returns a DC voltage approximately twice the supplied AC voltage. Through combinations of diodes and capacitors, both half-cycles are rectified and added together. Two ubiquitous configurations are respectively designated as "half-wave" doubler and "full-wave" doubler. The designation has more to do with the ripple frequency than how energy is transferred to the output. Ripple frequency in the "full-wave" doubler is twice the supply frequency. They can be implemented at normal line frequency or in switching power supplies.
A-4-1-9 (D) What are the two major ratings that must not be exceeded for silicon-diode rectifiers used in power-supply circuits?

Capacitor-input filters ensure high output voltage but poor regulation:  voltage soars to the peak AC value under no load and drops under load. Capacitor-input leads to high peak rectifier current. Choke-input filters limit the soar in voltage through counter-EMF and by opposing capacitor charge current. Peak rectifier current is constrained but output voltage approximates the average value of the AC waveform. Half-wave circuits have the poorest regulation.

A-4-2-6 (B) The main function of the bleeder resistor in a power supply is to provide a discharge path for the capacitor in the power supply. But it may also be used for a secondary function, which is to:
A	act as a secondary smoothing device in conjunction with the filter
B	improve voltage regulation
C	provide a ground return for the transformer

A-4-2-11 (D) In a properly designed choke input filter power supply, the no-load voltage across the filter capacitor will be about nine-tenths of the AC RMS voltage; yet it is advisable to use capacitors rated at the peak transformer voltage. Why is this large safety margin suggested?
A	Resonance can be set up in the filter producing high voltages
B	Under heavy load, high currents and voltages are produced
C	Under no-load conditions, the current could reach a high level
D	Under no-load conditions and a burned-out bleeder, voltages could reach the peak transformer voltage
> Inductors oppose changes in current. If no current at all is drawn from a choke-input filter, the effect of the inductor vanishes:  no more counter-EMF or opposition to peak capacitor charging current. Subsequent capacitors are allowed to fully charge to peak AC values. [ nine tenths the RMS:  RMS is 0.707 times peak, average is 0.637 times peak, 0.637 is nine tenths of 0.707 ]

Specifications include:  maximum output current, maximum output voltage, maximum input voltage and minimum input voltage (because a minimum voltage differential is needed to maintain regulation, the drop-out voltage).
A-4-3-10 (D) When extremely low ripple is required, or when the voltage supplied to the load must remain constant under conditions of large fluctuations of current and line voltage, a closed-loop amplifier is used to regulate the power supply. There are two main categories of electronic regulators. They are:
A	non-linear and switching
B	linear and non-linear
C	stiff and switching
D	linear and switching
> In a 'linear' voltage regulator, a voltage higher than necessary is first produced;  this voltage is brought down through a voltage dropping component. A regulator circuit (e.g., a Zener in a shunt configuration) may draw more or less current through a passive resistor to compensate for external changes. The dropping element, in a series configuration, may be a tube or transistor whose conduction may be varied. In a switching regulator, the incoming DC is switched on and off;  the on time is varied so that the average DC output is maintained regardless of current draw.
A-4-3-11 (A) A modern type of regulator, which features a reference, high-gain amplifier, temperature-compensated voltage sensing resistors and transistors as well as a pass element is commonly referred to as a:

A subsequent filter selects one of the sidebands to complete the creation of a single sideband suppressed-carrier signal. Note that there is no RF output when no audio is applied.
A-5-4-4 (C) Transmission with SSB, as compared to conventional AM transmission, results in:
A	a greater bandpass requirement in the receiver
B	3 dB gain in the transmitter
C	6 dB gain in the transmitter and 3 dB gain in the receiver
D	6 dB gain in the receiver
> Under noisy conditions, SSB can bring up to a 9 dB improvement over an AM signal of the same peak power. In AM, the Peak Envelope Power present in one of the two sidebands equals one fourth the carrier power:  e.g., a 100-watt AM transmitter only packs 25 watts PEP in each sideband. SSB concentrates all the available power in one sideband alone:  a 4 to 1 improvement or 6 dB. Using half the bandwidth on SSB reception, permits taking in only half of the noise at the receiver, an additional 3 dB improvement.
A-5-4-5 (C) The peak power output of a single-sideband transmitter, when being tested by a two-tone generator is:
A	one-half of the RF peak output power of any of the tones
B	one-quarter of the RF peak output power of any of the tones
C	twice the RF power output of any of the tones
D	equal to the RF peak output power of any of the tones
> A two-tone test permits verifying the linearity of an SSB transmitter. The test requires a generator producing two low-distortion non-harmonically related audio sine waves of equal amplitude. The frequencies must fall within the normal transmitter audio passband:  e.g., 700 and 1900 Hz. A sample of the transmitter's output is observed on an oscilloscope while the tones are fed into the microphone input. Feeding an SSB transmitter with two equal-amplitude steady audio tones produces two equal-amplitude RF signals:  total power is thus twice the power present in each RF signal.
A-5-4-6 (C) What kind of input signal is used to test the amplitude linearity of a single-sideband phone transmitter while viewing the output on an oscilloscope?

A-5-4-8 (A) What audio frequencies are used in a two-tone test of the linearity of a single-sideband phone transmitter?
A	Any two audio tones may be used, but they must be within the transmitter audio passband, and should not be harmonically related
B	20 Hz and 20 kHz tones must be used
C	1200 Hz and 2400 Hz tones must be used

A-5-4-10 (B) How much is the carrier suppressed below peak output power in a single-sideband phone transmission?
A	At least 60 dB
B	At least 40 dB
C	No more than 20 dB
D	No more than 30 dB
> "Most well-designed balanced modulators can provide between 30 and 50 dB of carrier suppression. ...The filter roll-off can be used to obtain an additional 20 dB of carrier suppression." (ARRL Handbook 1985)
A-5-4-11 (B) What is meant by "flat topping" in a single-sideband phone transmission?
A	The transmitter's carrier is properly suppressed
B	Signal distortion caused by excessive drive
C	Signal distortion caused by insufficient collector current
D	The transmitter's automatic level control is properly adjusted
> Flattening of the peaks is an extreme form of distortion where the output of the transmitter is incapable of reproducing the original pattern of the audio input on voice peaks. This is generally caused by excessive audio input to the transmitter:  too much audio causes the amplifier stage to exceed its linear operation range. The purpose of the ALC (Automatic Level Control) is to prevent overdrive.

A-5-7-1 (A) Maintaining the peak RF output of a SSB transmitter at a relatively constant level requires a circuit called the:
A	automatic level control (ALC)
B	automatic gain control (AGC)
C	automatic output control (AOC)
D	automatic volume control (AVC)
> Automatic Level Control (ALC) serves to prevent overdriving an amplifier. The ALC circuit samples the envelope (peak) of the RF output to develop a DC control voltage used to control the gain of an earlier stage. AGC and AVC are receiver circuits.
A-5-7-2 (C) Speech compression associated with SSB transmission implies:
A	a lower signal-to-noise ratio
B	circuit level instability
C	full amplification of low level signals and reducing or eliminating amplification of high level signals
D	full amplification of high level signals and reducing or eliminating signals amplification of low level
> Audio compression maintains a high voice level despite variations in the voice signal incoming from a microphone. To produce a high average output without exceeding a certain peak value, low level signals need to be amplified while high level signals are passed along with little or no gain. [ compression is the automatic reduction of gain as the signal level increases beyond a pre-set level known as the threshold. ]
A-5-7-7 (B) Which principle is not associated with analog signal processing?
A	Clipping
B	Frequency division
C	Compression
D	Bandwidth limiting
> Key words:  NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANALOG. Compression, bandwidth limiting and clipping can all be performed as analog processes. Frequency division requires a numerical computation.
A-5-7-8 (B) Which of the following is not a method used for peak limiting, in a signal processor?
A	AF clipping
B	Frequency clipping
C	RF clipping
D	Compression
> The expression "peak limiting" entails limiting the amplitude. Compression, AF clipping and RF clipping are valid operations. There is no such thing as frequency clipping.
A-5-7-9 (B) What is the undesirable result of AF clipping in a speech processor?
A	Reduction in peak amplitude
B	Increased harmonic distortion
C	Reduced average power
D	Increased average power
> Audio frequency clipping abruptly stops voltage excursions at a certain level. This gives the audio a square wave appearance;  square waves are rich in harmonics. AF clippers need to be followed by a low-pass filter to prevent harmonics from entering modulation stages. You may also eliminate the bad answers:  "reduction in peak amplitude" is the object of clipping, "increased average power" is a result of clipping (softer passages are no longer dwarfed by the peaks), "increased average power" simply contradicts the previous answer.
A-5-7-10 (C) Which description is not correct? You are planning to build a speech processor for your transceiver. Compared to AF clipping, RF clipping:
A	is more expensive to implement
B	is more difficult to implement
C	is easier to implement
D	has less distortion
> Working at radio-frequencies is evidently more difficult and thus more expensive than dealing with audio frequencies. RF clipping is generally presumed to induce less distortion because any harmonics generated through clipping automatically end up outside the passband of subsequent filters. At audio frequencies, harmonics of the lower speech frequencies fall within the audio passband and can muddle the audio signal.
A-5-7-11 (B) Automatic Level Control (ALC) is another name for:
A	AF clipping
B	RF compression
C	AF compression
D	RF clipping
> Clipping places a hard limit on voltage swings. Compression is a reduction in gain when signal exceed a certain threshold. The ALC circuit samples the envelope (peak) of the RF output and produces a DC control voltage used to control the gain of an earlier stage when the output reaches a certain level.

A-5-5-1 (D) In an FM phone signal having a maximum frequency deviation of 3000 Hz either side of the carrier frequency, what is the modulation index, when the modulating frequency is 1000 Hz?
A	0.3
B	3000
C	1000
D	3
> Deviation = the amount of frequency shift, at a given instant, from the centre carrier frequency (e.g., plus or minus 5 kHz). Modulation Index = the ratio of deviation to modulating frequency for a particular audio frequency (both being expressed in the same units):  e.g., 3 kHz deviation with 1 kHz audio represents a Modulation Index of 3. Deviation Ratio = the ratio of maximum deviation to the maximum modulating frequency:  e.g. maximum deviation of 5 kHz with a highest modulating frequency of 3 kHz is a Deviation Ratio of 1.66 .
A-5-5-2 (A) What is the modulation index of an FM phone transmitter producing an instantaneous carrier deviation of 6 kHz when modulated with a 2 kHz modulating frequency?

A-5-5-5 (B) When the transmitter is not modulated, or the amplitude of the modulating signal is zero, the frequency of the carrier is called its:
A	modulating frequency
B	centre frequency
C	frequency deviation
D	frequency shift
> Centre Frequency is the transmitter output frequency in the absence of modulation. Frequency deviation and frequency shift both are synonyms for the offset in carrier frequency caused by modulation at a given instant. Modulating frequency relates to the audio frequency used for modulation.
A-5-5-6 (C) In an FM transmitter system, the amount of deviation from the centre frequency is determined solely by the:
A	amplitude and the frequency of the modulating frequency
B	modulating frequency and the amplitude of the centre frequency
C	amplitude of the modulating frequency
D	frequency of the modulating frequency
> In Frequency Modulation,  the amplitude of the modulation is translated into the importance of the deviation, the modulation frequency is reflected in the rhythm of the deviation.
A-5-5-7 (A) Any FM wave with single-tone modulation has:
A	an infinite number of sideband frequencies
B	two sideband frequencies
C	four sideband frequencies
D	one sideband frequency
> Unlike AM where a single modulating frequency creates only a pair of side frequencies (one on each side of the carrier), FM creates an infinite number of side frequency pairs;  the Modulation Index influences the amplitude of the side frequencies through a mathematical relation known as a Bessel Function. The number of side frequencies with significant amplitude determines the required bandwidth. For certain Modulation Index values, there is zero energy at the centre frequency;  the energy is then totally found in the side frequencies.
A-5-5-8 (A) Some types of deviation meters work on the principle of:
A	a carrier null and multiplying the modulation frequency by the modulation index
B	detecting the frequencies in the sidebands
C	the amplitude of power in the sidebands
D	a carrier peak and dividing by the modulation index
> Certain Modulation Index values cause nulls at the centre carrier frequency:  e.g., the Bessel function returns zero for the carrier component at Modulation Indices of 2.4048, 5.5201 or 8.6537 . Detecting a carrier null permits determining deviation as Modulation Index times modulating frequency. For Radiople, with a tone of 905 hertz and deviation set at 4996 hertz (nearly 5 kHz), a null in the carrier will be observed because 4996 Hz deviation for a tone of 905 Hz is a Modulation Index of 5.52 . An all-mode receiver with a sharp filter permits observing the carrier component. The procedure could be used to set a transmitter or calibrate a home-made deviation meter.
' Expressed to 8 decimal places, the first three indices producing Bessel nulls for J(0) are 2.40482556, 5.52007811 and 8.65372791.
A-5-5-9 (B) When using some deviation meters, it is important to know:
A	pass-band of the IF filter
B	modulating frequency and the modulation index
C	modulation index
D	modulating frequency

A-5-5-10 (D) What is the significant bandwidth of an FM-phone transmission having a +/- 5-kHz deviation and a 3-kHz modulating frequency?
A	8 kHz
B	5 kHz
C	3 kHz
D	16 kHz
> Carson's Rule permits estimating the bandwidth of an FM signal:  bandwidth equals twice the sum of deviation + modulating frequency, in this Radiople,  5 + 3 = 8, twice 8 = 16. [ Mathematician and engineer John R. Carson (1887-1940) had predicted the approximate bandwidth of an FM signal circa 1922. ]
A-5-5-11 (D) What is the frequency deviation for a 12.21-MHz reactance-modulated oscillator in a +/- 5-kHz deviation, 146.52-MHz FM-phone transmitter?
A	+/- 12 kHz
B	+/- 5 kHz
C	+/- 41.67 Hz
D	+/- 416.7 Hz
> In this Radiople, the frequency multiplication ratio between oscillator and output is 12 ( 146.52 divided by 12.21 = 12 ). Hence, the oscillator needs only be shifted by 416.7 Hz, i.e., 5000 Hz divided by 12.

A-5-6-5 (A) What type of circuit varies the tuning of an amplifier tank circuit to produce FM signals?
A	A phase modulator
B	A balanced modulator
C	A double balanced mixer
D	An audio modulator
> Two methods exist to produce Frequency Modulation. The Direct Method supposes forcing deviation directly on the oscillator;  deviation is then multiplied along with the oscillator frequency up to the operating frequency. Phase Modulation is an indirect method whereby the phase of the signal is affected (i.e., retarding/advancing) in step with the modulation by varying a reactance on a stage other than the oscillator.
A-5-6-6 (A) What audio shaping network is added at an FM transmitter to attenuate the lower audio frequencies?
A	A pre-emphasis network
B	An audio prescaler
C	A heterodyne suppressor
D	A de-emphasis network
> With direct FM, deviation is independent of modulating frequency, actual deviation is determined solely by the modulating amplitude. With Phase Modulation, deviation depends on the amount of phase shift and its rapidity, increasing modulating frequency results in proportionally more deviation even if amplitude is held constant. Because commercial standards were based on Phase Modulation, an FM transmitter requires an artificial boost in high frequency response so that PM and FM sound the same at the receiver. A pre-emphasis network tailors the frequency response in the FM transmitter. De-emphasis is employed in the receiver to restore a flat audio response.
A-5-6-8 (D) The characteristic difference between a phase modulator and a frequency modulator is:
A	the centre frequency
B	de-emphasis
C	frequency inversion
D	pre-emphasis

A-5-6-9 (A) In most modern FM transmitters, to produce a better sound, a compressor and a clipper are placed:
A	between the audio amplifier and the modulator
B	between the multiplier and the PA
C	between the modulator and the oscillator
D	in the microphone circuit, before the audio amplifier
> In this context, compression and clipping are AUDIO processes aimed at maintaining high average deviation without exceeding a given peak value. Two answers can be readily scratched as they pertain to radiofrequency (RF) paths. The microphone circuit is not suitable as the audio level at that point is too low for a simple clipper.
A-5-6-10 (D) Three important parameters to be verified in an FM transmitter are:
A	distortion, bandwidth and sideband power
B	modulation, pre-emphasis and carrier suppression
C	frequency stability, de-emphasis and linearity
D	power, frequency deviation and frequency stability
> Stability is paramount in all transmitters, frequency deviation ultimately determines bandwidth while linearity (absence of distortion) minimizes out-of-channel emissions. Carrier Suppression is a concern with SSB, pre-emphasis (FM transmitter) and de-emphasis (FM receiver) are simple resistor-capacitor networks.

{L16} FM Repeaters.

A-5-6-1 (B) If the signals of two repeater transmitters mix together in one or both of their final amplifiers and unwanted signals at the sum and difference frequencies of the original signals are generated and radiated, what is this called?
A	Amplifier desensitization
B	Intermodulation interference
C	Neutralization
D	Adjacent channel interference
> Intermodulation is the unwanted mixing of two or more signals that produce new signals (products). The fundamental or harmonic energy from strong nearby transmitters intermix to create intermodulation products. Mixing can take place in the front-end of the affected receiver, in the Power Amplifier of one of the transmitters or through "external rectification or passive intermodulation" (in some electronic device or some corroded junction between two metals acting as a diode mixer).
A-5-6-2 (A) How does intermodulation interference between two repeater transmitters usually occur?
A	When they are in close proximity and the signals mix in one or both of their final amplifiers
B	When the signals are reflected in phase by aircraft passing overhead
C	When they are in close proximity and the signals cause feedback in one or both of their final amplifiers
D	When the signals are reflected out of phase by aircraft passing overhead
> Intermodulation is the unwanted mixing of two or more signals that produce new signals (products).

A-5-6-3 (B) How can intermodulation interference between two repeater transmitters in close proximity often be reduced or eliminated?
A	By using a Class C final amplifier with high driving power
B	By installing a terminated circulator or ferrite isolator in the transmission line to the transmitter and duplexer
C	By installing a low-pass filter in the antenna transmission line
D	By installing a high-pass filter in the antenna transmission line
> A circulator is usually a three-port device;  any energy coming in one port is forwarded in one direction only, towards the next port. An isolator is a circulator with one port terminated into a dummy load. With the transmitter on port 1, the antenna on port 2 and a dummy load on port 3, RF from the transmitter is routed to the antenna but any outside energy picked-up by the antenna is diverted to the dummy load and thus cannot enter the Power Amplifier where it might lead to intermodulation. Magnetized ferrite material is used in the fabrication of circulators.
A-5-6-4 (D) If a receiver tuned to 146.70 MHz receives an intermodulation product signal whenever a nearby transmitter transmits on 146.52, what are the two most likely frequencies for the other interfering signal?
A	146.88 MHz and 146.34 MHz
B	146.01 MHz and 147.30 MHz
C	73.35 MHz and 239.40 MHz
D	146.34 MHz and 146.61 MHz
> Third Order Intermodulation products where the second harmonic of one signal mixes with the fundamental frequency of another are the most troublesome because of the relative frequency proximity of the involved signals:  filtering them out is difficult. Given two signals, F1 and F2, the Third Order IMD product can be computed as (a) "twice F1 minus F2" or (b) "twice F2 minus F1". In this Radiople, IMD = 146.70, F1 = 146.52 ; solving for F2 in case "a" is (F1 times 2), minus IMD ;  solving for F2 in case "b" is (IMD + F1), divided by 2.
A-5-6-7 (D) Which type of filter would be best to use in a 2-metre repeater duplexer?
A	A DSP filter
B	An L-C filter
C	A crystal filter
D	A cavity filter
> In the context of a repeater installation, a duplexer is a specialized filter which allows operating the receiver and transmitter simultaneously on the same antenna. The duplexer is built with four or more quarter-wavelength cavity resonators. The duplexer provides isolation ( 90 dB or more on 2 m ) between the receive and transmit paths at the expense of insertion loss.
A-5-6-11 (A) Intermodulation interference products are not typically associated with which of the following:
A	intermediate frequency stage
B	final amplifier stage
C	receiver frontend
D	passive intermodulation
> "Undesired mixing of two or more frequencies in a non-linear device which produces additional sum and difference frequencies" (ARRL RFI Book). Final amplifier stage: signals from nearby transmitters may find their way into a power amplifier creating intermodulation. Receiver front-end: strong offending signals may enter the RF amplifier or mixer and create intermodulation. Passive intermodulation (PIM), sometimes called "rusty bolt effect": passive devices subjected to strong signals cause the problem; cables, antennas, connectors, dissimilar metals, etc. due to oxidation, corrosion, metal flakes, dirty mating surfaces or poor contact.

The Data Link layer packages data bits into frames, provides error-free transfer of frames including physical addressing, network topology, error notification. The Network layer (for Radiople, Internetwork Protocol) uses logical addresses to route frames through a network of links. The Transport layer (for Radiople, TCP Transmission Control Protocol) provides the end-to-end control, ensures that data is complete and properly sequenced ( e.g., retransmissions ).

C	Lossless compression
D	Error detection
> "A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data" (Wikipedia). A CRC is computed at the originating end and sent with the message; the receiving end does the same calculation, a mismatch in the CRC indicates that the payload was damaged. The CRC manages error detection, other mechanisms can provide error correction.
A-5-8-4 (A) What is one advantage of using ASCII rather than Baudot code?
A	It includes both upper and lower case text characters in the code

> With 5 bits, Baudot can accommodate 32 combinations ( 2 exponent 5 ) per character set;  one set represents uppercase letters A through Z, the other are figures 0 through 9 plus other symbols. The original ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) used seven bits to accommodate 128 combinations;  enough for lowercase and uppercase letters, all digits and other symbols. So called "extended ASCII" uses 8 bits for a total of 256 combinations, this adds accented letters.

APRS also supports global call sign-to-call sign messaging (...)" (www.aprs.org Bob Bruninga WB4APR). Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) is a standard for systems capable of automatically selecting a band and frequency from a list of channels for HF communications with a given similarly-equipped station.
A-5-8-8 (C) Which algorithm may be used to create a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)?
A	Convolution code
B	Lempel-Ziv routine
C	Hash function
D	Dynamic Huffman code
> "A hash function is any algorithm that maps data of arbitrary length to data of a fixed length. (...)  The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, checksums or simply hashes" (Wikipedia). A convolutional code is a type of error-correcting code (e.g., Viterbi or Reed-Solomon). Lempel-Ziv and Dynamic Huffman coding are lossless data compression algorithms.

A	packet
B	RTTY
C	ASCII
D	spread spectrum speech
> Packet radio adheres to the AX.25 protocol. AX.25 is derived from the X.25 networking protocol:  one notable difference is the use of call signs as addresses. AX.25 uses a Frame-Check Sequence for error detection. The Frame-Check sequence (FCS) is a sixteen-bit number calculated by both the sending and receiving stations of a frame. Comparing the received FCS with a locally computed one permits detecting corruption in transit.

A	5
B	7
C	8
D	6
> With 5 bits, Baudot can accommodate 32 combinations ( 2 exponent 5 ) per character set;  one set represents uppercase letters A through Z, the other are figures 0 through 9 plus other symbols. The original ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) used seven bits to accommodate 128 combinations;  enough for lowercase and uppercase letters, all digits and other symbols. So called "extended ASCII" uses 8 bits for a total of 256 combinations, this adds accented letters.

B	it phases out the unwanted sideband signal
C	it reduces the pass-band of the IF stages
D	it beats with the receiver carrier to produce the missing sideband

A	sensitive and selective
B	stable and sensitive
C	selective and spectrally pure
D	stable and spectrally pure
> Oscillators need to be free of drift regardless of voltage and temperature variations or mechanical vibrations. Spectral purity is the absence of harmonics, other spurious oscillations or noise;  purity limits spurious responses in the subsequent mixing processes.
A-6-2-7 (C) In a superheterodyne receiver, a stage before the IF amplifier has a variable capacitor in parallel with a trimmer capacitor and an inductance. The variable capacitor is for:
A	tuning of the beat-frequency oscillator (BFO)

B	The weakest signal that can be detected under noisy atmospheric conditions
C	The minimum level of noise that will overload the receiver RF amplifier stage
D	The amount of noise generated by the receiver local oscillator
> A receiver's "Noise Floor" is the power level at which an incoming signal exhibits a Signal-To-Noise ratio of zero decibel:  that is, the signal power equals the internal noise power level. Noise Floor is evaluated while measuring "Minimum Discernible Signal (MDS)". The "Noise Figure" of a receiver is a comparison of Signal-to-Noise ratio at the input and Signal-to-Noise ratio at the output;  it assesses the degradation in Signal-to-Noise ratio caused by added noise. A low Noise Figure suggests that little noise was added internally and is a hallmark of sensitivity. The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

C	It depends on the amplification factor of the first IF stage
D	Sufficient gain to keep weak signals below the noise of the first mixer stage
> The Radio-Frequency Amplifier should only introduce enough gain to override the internal noise of the subsequent Mixer. Too much gain will degrade Dynamic Range;  Dynamic Range is broadly defined as a ratio between the strongest signals that can be tolerated near the passband and the "Minimum Discernible Signal".
A-6-3-4 (B) What is the primary purpose of an RF amplifier in a receiver?
A	To provide most of the receiver gain
B	To improve the receiver noise figure
C	To vary the receiver image rejection by using the AGC

A	Noise Figure in decibels
B	Overall gain in decibels
C	RF level for 12 dB SINAD
D	RF level for a given Bit Error Rate (BER)
> The SINAD (signal + noise + distortion over noise + distortion) ratio takes the SNR (signal + noise over noise ratio) one step further by including distortion. A 12 dB SINAD ratio ensures that speech remains intelligible. Sensitivity expressed in those terms is the lowest RF level that will produce a usable message. The RF signal generator must be calibrated so the number of microvolts is precisely determined. Total Harmonic Distortion compares unwanted harmonic components added to the desired fundamental frequency, an audio tone in this instance.
A-6-3-6 (C) What is the term used for the decibel difference (or ratio) between the largest tolerable receiver input signal (without causing audible distortion products) and the minimum discernible signal (sensitivity)?

A-6-3-7 (A) The lower the receiver noise figure becomes, the greater will be the receiver's _________:
A	sensitivity
B	rejection of unwanted signals
C	selectivity
D	stability

The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.
A-6-3-9 (C) Why are very low noise figures relatively unimportant for a high frequency receiver?
A	The use of SSB and CW on the HF bands overcomes the noise
B	Regardless of the front end, the succeeding stages when used on HF are very noisy
C	External HF noise, man-made and natural, are higher than the internal noise generated by the receiver
D	Ionospheric distortion of the received signal creates high noise levels
> Below 30 megahertz, the antenna picks-up atmospheric noise and man-made noise at levels far more important than internal noise. As the frequency of operation rises, those types of noise become less prevalent. On Ultra High Frequencies (UHF) and above, the internal noise becomes the limiting factor in receiving weak signals. The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver:  for weak signal work on 2 metres and up, more attention must be placed on reducing internal noise in the front-end.
A-6-3-10 (B) The term which relates specifically to the amplitude levels of multiple signals that can be accommodated during reception is called:
A	noise figure
B	dynamic range
C	AGC
D	cross-modulation index
> Dynamic Range is broadly defined as a ratio between the strongest signals that can be tolerated near the passband and the "Minimum Discernible Signal". Other related notions include Blocking Dynamic Range and Intermodulation Dynamic Range. Blocking Dynamic Range measures how much of a single strong off-channel signal can be tolerated while receiving a weak signal, it is a measure of desensitization or immunity to overload. Intermodulation Dynamic Range verifies how strong two off-channel signals can be without spurious responses being generated in the receiver, it is a measure of resistance to intermodulation.
A-6-3-11 (B) Normally, front-end selectivity is provided by the resonant networks both before and after the RF stage in a superheterodyne receiver. This whole section of the receiver is often referred to as the:
A	pass-selector
B	preselector
C	preamble
D	preamplifier
> A preselector is a tuned stage which passes a desired range of signals to a receiver:  it ensures a certain preliminary selection. It may or may not be amplified;  in other words, active or passive.
A-6-4-1 (B) What audio shaping network is added at an FM receiver to restore proportionally attenuated lower audio frequencies?
A	A heterodyne suppressor
B	A de-emphasis network
C	A pre-emphasis network
D	An audio prescaler
> With "true" FM, deviation is independent of modulating frequency, actual deviation is determined solely by the modulating amplitude. With Phase Modulation, deviation depends on the amount of phase shift and its rapidity, increasing modulating frequency results in proportionally more deviation even if amplitude is held constant. Because commercial standards were based on Phase Modulation, an FM transmitter requires an artificial boost in high frequency response so that PM and FM sound the same at the receiver. A pre-emphasis network tailors the frequency response in the FM transmitter. De-emphasis is employed in the receiver to restore a flat audio response.
A-6-4-2 (C) What does a product detector do?

> Waveguides, used as transmission lines, are hollow pipes through which signals propagate as waves. The width or diameter of the waveguide must be slightly larger than a half-wavelength at the operating frequency. Below one gigahertz, dimensions become prohibitive. Signals with wavelengths too large for the physical size of the waveguide are attenuated:  waveguides behave like high-pass filters, in other words, attenuation below the cutoff frequency. Waveguides do not suffer the conduction, dielectric or radiation losses that normal transmission lines present at microwave frequencies.
A-7-9-10 (B) Stripline is a:
A	family of fluids for removing coatings from small parts
B	printed circuit transmission line
C	small semiconductor family
D	high power microwave antenna
> A Microstrip transmission line is a type of line consisting of a thin and flat strip of conductive material separated from a ground plane by a dielectric. A double-sided printed circuit board lends itself to the construction of microstrip lines:  traces on top with a ground plane underneath. Characteristic Impedance is determined by trace width, dielectric thickness and dielectric constant. External shielding may be required when high isolation is required. Stripline uses a similar thin and flat conductor but sandwiched between two parallel ground planes.
A-7-9-11 (C) What precautions should you take before beginning repairs on a microwave feed horn or waveguide?
A	Be sure propagation conditions are unfavourable for tropospheric ducting
B	Be sure to wear tight-fitting clothes and gloves to protect your body and hands from sharp edges
C	Be sure the transmitter is turned off and the power source is disconnected
D	Be sure the weather is dry and sunny
> With the possibility of shorter wavelengths to reach deeper into the body or to produce resonances in smaller structures, such as the eye, be extra careful not to expose anyone to microwave radiation. The significant gain available from physically small antennas also turn low power levels into definite risks. Heating is one known effect of RF on body tissues, other effects are possible.

A-7-5-1 (D) What is meant by circularly polarized electromagnetic waves?
A	Waves with an electric field bent into circular shape
B	Waves that circle the earth
C	Waves produced by a circular loop antenna
D	Waves with a rotating electric field
> The polarization of an electromagnetic radio wave corresponds to the position of the electrical field with respect to the surface of the Earth:  horizontal when the E field is parallel to ground and vertical when perpendicular to ground. The magnetic field is at 90 degrees (perpendicular) to the electrical field. Dipoles and Yagis are linearly polarized antennas (i.e., the electrical field has a constant orientation). Circular polarization, where the polarization rotates, can be obtained from helical beam antennas or with crossed linear antennas fed with the correct phase difference. "Sense" refers to the direction of the rotation:  clockwise polarization for a receding wave is termed right-hand.
A-7-5-2 (A) What type of polarization is produced by crossed dipoles fed 90 degrees out of phase?
A	Circular polarization
B	Cross-polarization
C	Perpendicular polarization
D	None of the other answers, the two fields cancel out

C	Loaded helical-wound antenna
D	Crossed dipoles fed 90 degrees out of phase
> Key word:  NOT. Antennas featuring a fine wire wound around a shaft (e.g., HF mobile antennas) are "loaded helical-wound antennas"; these produce a linear polarization, i.e., vertical or horizontal depending on their positions relative to ground. The axial-mode helical antenna, with its corkscrew look, is used in satellite work and produces circular polarization.
A-7-5-4 (C) On VHF/UHF frequencies, Doppler shift becomes of consequence on which type of communication?
A	Simplex line-of-sight contact between hand-held transceivers
B	Contact with terrestrial mobile stations
C	Contact via satellite
D	Contact through a hilltop repeater
> "Doppler shift: the change in frequency of a received signal due to the motion of the satellite. This requires adjustment of the transmit or receive frequency, with the common practice being to change the higher of the two frequencies in use" (http://www.amsat.org/). Low Earth orbiting satellites travel at speeds around 28,000 km/h. The higher the operating frequency, the higher the possible shift: for Radiople, +/- 600 Hz on 10 m, +/- 3 kHz on 2 m and +/- 9 kHz on 70 cm.

A	6 dB
B	10 dB
C	20 dB or more
D	3 dB
> "A loss in signal strength of 20 dB or more can be expected with cross-polarization so it is important to use antennas with the same polarization as the stations with which you expect to communicate."  (ARRL Antenna Book, 22nd ed., section 21.10.5 Polarization)
A-7-5-6 (C) Which of the following is NOT a valid parabolic dish illumination arrangement?
A	Offset feed
B	Cassegrain
C	Newtonian
D	Front feed
> Key word: NOT. Front feed (also known as focal feed or axial feed): circular reflector, the feed is centered in front of the reflector, very common on larger dish antennas. Offset feed (also known as off-axis): elliptical reflector, the feed is off to one side, out of the path of the radio waves, typical of domestic satellite receiving antennas. Cassegrain (based on the Cassegrain telescope): the feed is behind the dish and relies on a small convex secondary reflector in front of the dish. Newtonian: a bogus answer, valid for telescopes.
A-7-5-7 (B) A parabolic antenna is very efficient because:
A	a horn-type radiator can be used to trap the received energy
B	all the received energy is focused to a point where the pick-up antenna is located
C	a dipole antenna can be used to pick up the received energy
D	no impedance matching is required
> A parabolic reflector dish provides significant gain because energy striking any point of the parabola is reflected to the focal point with the correct phase. On transmit, the inverse process takes place:  all energy directed at the parabola from the feed antenna is reflected forward with the correct phase. High gain antennas used on UHF or microwave frequencies present a real risk to living tissues:  never stand in front of a transmitting antenna.
A-7-5-8 (D) A helical-beam antenna with right-hand polarization will best receive signals with:
A	left-hand polarization
B	vertical polarization only
C	horizontal polarization
D	right-hand polarization
> The helical beam antenna is circularly polarized. Although it will respond to horizontally or vertically polarized waves, the full gain of the antenna can only be realized with a circularly polarized wave of the same "sense".
A-7-5-9 (A) One antenna which will respond simultaneously to vertically- and horizontally-polarized signals is the:
A	helical-beam antenna
B	folded dipole antenna
C	ground-plane antenna
D	quad antenna
> The dipole, ground-plane and quad are all linearly polarized and thus respond optimally to waves polarized in a single given direction, horizontal or vertical as the case may be. Unless proper alignment is assured, a significant loss is incurred. The helical beam antenna is circularly polarized, it can deal with the rotating fields of a wave with circular polarization. Consequently, it can deal with any single polarization at any given angle.
A-7-5-10 (D) In amateur work, what is the surface error upper limit you should try not to exceed on a parabolic reflector?
A	0.25 lambda
B	5 mm (0.2 in) regardless of frequency
C	1% of the diameter
D	0.1 lambda
> "Surface errors should not exceed 1/8 lambda in amateur operation. At 430 MHz, 1/8 lambda is 3.4 inches [8.6 cm], but at 10 GHz, it is 0.1476 inch [3.7 mm]! (...)  Mesh can be used for the reflector surface to reduce weight and wind loading, but hole size should be less than 1/12 lambda." (ARRL Antenna Book 22nd ed., sect. 15.6.2)
A-7-5-11 (B) You want to convert a surplus parabolic dish for amateur radio use, the gain of this antenna depends on:
A	the material composition of the dish
B	the diameter of the antenna in wavelengths

A-7-7-1 (C) For a 3-element Yagi antenna with horizontally mounted elements, how does the main lobe takeoff angle vary with height above flat ground?
A	It does not vary with height
B	It depends on E-region height, not antenna height
C	It decreases with increasing height
D	It increases with increasing height
> Greater antenna heights tend to lower the main radiation lobe where ground reflections end up in phase with direct radiation from the antenna.
A-7-7-2 (D) Most simple horizontally polarized antennas do not exhibit significant directivity unless they are:
A	an eighth of a wavelength above the ground
B	a quarter wavelength above the ground
C	three-eighths of a wavelength above the ground
D	a half wavelength or more above the ground
> Below one half-wavelength in antenna height, there is little point in selecting a given broadside direction:  for Radiople, choosing a north-south orientation to favour east-west radiation will not pay significant dividends for antennas close to ground.

A-7-7-4 (C) Why is a ground-mounted vertical quarter-wave antenna in reasonably open surroundings better for long distance contacts than a half-wave dipole at a quarter wavelength above ground?
A	It has an omnidirectional characteristic
B	It uses vertical polarization
C	The vertical radiation angle is lower
D	The radiation resistance is lower
> Key words:  DIPOLE AT A QUARTER WAVELENGTH HEIGHT. At heights below three eights of a wavelength, ground reflections cause horizontal dipoles to direct more energy straight up. At a height of one half-wavelength, radiation at 90 degrees is minimized and two lobes form at 30 degrees. In this comparison, the ground-mounted vertical undoubtedly exhibits a lower radiation angle as it cannot possibly radiate upwards.

A	If the antenna is less than one-half wavelength high, reflected radio waves from the ground significantly distort the pattern
B	Antenna height has no effect on the pattern
C	If the antenna is less than one-half wavelength high, radiation off the ends of the wire is eliminated
D	If the antenna is too high, the pattern becomes unpredictable
> Below one half-wavelength in antenna height, there is little point in selecting a given broadside direction:  for Radiople, choosing a north-south orientation to favour east-west radiation will not pay significant dividends for antennas close to ground.
A-7-7-7 (B) For long distance propagation, the vertical radiation angle of the energy from the antenna should be:
A	more than 30 degrees but less than 45 degrees
